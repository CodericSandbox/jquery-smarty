I'm working on bringing the smarty templating engine to javascript (jQSmarty).

Benefits of this is that you will have a client side templating engine. So as it uses the same engine as smarty (PHP), you can have a dual side templating engine. But with Jaxer there is no need for the server-side installation, so you can just use a single one.

Benefits of basing it on Smarty is that it will work with current Smarty implementations, and will work alongside Smarty on legacy (non Jaxer) servers.

The current version of jQSmarty is 0.1.0.0-dev, you can see it here:
http://www.balupton.com/sandbox/jquery_smarty/
It's not that usable right now, but supports some basic syntax/functions/modifiers, the core is nearly all done.

So just making this post to find out if anyone else is interested in this? And if so, hopefully can help out with it's development.
As well as to talk about other javascript templating engines.

I have a more detailed explanation on how Jaxer is a silver bullet for templating here:
